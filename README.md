## Clarifai NPM Demo

This is a demo to show people how simple it can be to wrap an api. In this case
we're using Clarifai's api for authorization and tagging..

This is not for production use, nor is it for development use.

This is merely a basic blueprint so show people how you can make a very basic
wrapper around a rest api.
